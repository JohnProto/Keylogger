# Keylogger
A simple keylogger I made with C++.


Made a keylogger using the c language that logs all the keystrokes of the keyboard to a .txt file. I also compiled it to an .exe file so it can run without needing VSCode to be open. First i open up a cmd window and close it instantly and then after each keystroke, I check if the key pressed is a special key (Space, Backspace, Alt, Ctrl, Tab, Capslock, Shift) and I do the corresponding adjustments to the .txt file.
